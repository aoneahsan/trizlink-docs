## ⏳ Pending manual tasks

| # | Task | Why only you | Status |
|---|------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | **Add DNS.** In Hostinger, add a `CNAME` record `docs` → `aoneahsan.github.io` on `trizlink.com`. | Only you control the `trizlink.com` DNS zone. | ☐ Not started |
| 2 | **Configure GitHub Pages.** Repo **Settings → Pages**: source = **GitHub Actions**, custom domain = `docs.trizlink.com`, then **Enforce HTTPS** once the certificate provisions. | Repo settings are owner-only. | ☐ Not started |

`static/CNAME` already ships `docs.trizlink.com` inside `build/`, and `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` builds and
publishes on every push to `main` — these steps are all that remain.
